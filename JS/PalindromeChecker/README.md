# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter a word in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button to see if the word is a palindrome.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for checking palindromes.

## Example

Enter the word "racecar" and click "Check". The application will confirm that "racecar" is a palindrome.
